## Storybook

- What and Why ?

- it storybook is basically a development environment and playground for ui components
- it enables you to create components independently and showcase those components interactively in an isolated development environment
- what that last part means is that storybook runs outside of your main react application
- so you can develop ui components in isolation without having to worry about the business logic
- but that is the theoretical what and why of storybook
- let's talk practical now
- when we work as a team on a react application, there are a few things that will make development across the team smoother
- one is the ability to view the different components that have already been developed as part of the app
- two is the ability to view what are the different props that those developed components accept
- three is the ability to visually showcase those components to your stakeholders for feedback
- apart from these, it would be incredible if you can change the props on a component and immediately see the changes in the ui without having to move back and forth between the browser and your editor
- if you could also get some feedback about the accessibility score of the component like color contrast, it would be like a cherry on top
- as you might have already guessed storybook will help you with all these
- if you start working at a company you're more likely to come across a tool like storybook
- if your team currently doesn't use it now is a great time to learn and start using it in your projects
- so in this tutorial series, we will set up storybook in a react app ,write stories and add a bunch of useful features to make the development experience for your team a whole lot better
